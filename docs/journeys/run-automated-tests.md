# Run Automated Tests

This journey explains how to automatically execute simulations to identify the best audio and video setups.

## Steps

1. **Navigate to the Automated Testing Section**: On the landing page, locate the "Automated Testing" section.
2. **Understand the Process**: Read the description to understand how the system automates simulations based on pre-defined criteria.
3. **Initiate a Test Run**: Although automated, the system may allow manual triggering of tests. Observe the simulation process and its loading state.
4. **Monitor Results**: The system will process the test and display results showing optimal configuration details.
5. **Review Test Metrics**: Analyze the provided metrics to determine performance indicators like latency and quality.

Follow these steps to benefit from automated testing for your setups.
